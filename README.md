# Reduced-Rank Wiener Filtering

This repository contains MATLAB implementations for **Lanczos-based Multistage Nested Wiener Filtering (MSNWF)**, also known as **Krylov Subspace Wiener Filtering**. The primary focus is on **reduced-rank signal processing** techniques for **noise removal** and **QPSK bit error rate (BER)** analysis.

## Overview

These scripts demonstrate:
- Construction of reduced-rank Wiener filters using the Lanczos/Krylov subspace method. 
- Simulation of noise suppression in communication or sensor data. 
- QPSK modulation and BER performance evaluation under various noise conditions.

## Status

Files and documentation are being organized and will be updated soon.

## References

Key concepts are based on reduced-rank filtering theory and its applications in adaptive signal processing and communications.
